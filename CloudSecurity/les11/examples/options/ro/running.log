Limit the mounted filesystem to be read-only.
Provide an in-memory storage for temporary files at /tmp.
Bind your local partition /usr/local/myapp using the read-only option too.
You can also create a read-only bind mount:
++ docker run --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid -v /usr/local/myapp:/app/:ro myimage
uid=100(appuser) gid=101(appgroup) groups=101(appgroup)
