Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated
with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
