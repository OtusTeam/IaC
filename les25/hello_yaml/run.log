The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained. 
If you want to remove the stack completely, run `pulumi stack rm dev`.
++ pulumi stack rm dev
This will permanently remove the 'dev' stack!
Please confirm that this is what you'd like to do by typing `dev`: dev
Stack 'dev' has been removed!
++ set +x
