The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained. 
If you want to remove the stack completely, run `pulumi stack rm test`.
++ pulumi stack rm test
This will permanently remove the 'test' stack!
Please confirm that this is what you'd like to do by typing `test`: test
Stack 'test' has been removed!
