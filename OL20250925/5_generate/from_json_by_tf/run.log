yandex_compute_instance.this["hello"]: Refreshing state... [id=fhm9i2m8fes2krp2ke2o]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
